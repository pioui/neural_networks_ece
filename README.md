## Lab 1 - Supervised Learning
Utilize supervised classifiers, namely Gaussian Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Logistic Regression, to train models for classifying EEG Eye state Dataset. Implement grid search optimization tools to enhance the classification performance, thereby refining the accuracy and effectiveness of the models.

#### libraries: pandas, scikit-learn
