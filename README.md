## Lab 1 - Supervised Learning
Utilize supervised classifiers, namely Gaussian Naive Bayes, k-Nearest Neighbors (kNN), and Logistic Regression, to train models for classifying EEG Eye state Dataset. Implement grid search optimization tools to enhance the classification performance, thereby refining the accuracy and effectiveness of the models.

## Lab 2 - Unsupervised Learning

Develop a content-based movie recommendation system by transforming the dataset into Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (tf-idf) format. Employ various preprocessing techniques, such as the removal of irrelevant information, stopwords, and lemmatization, to optimize the tf-idf representation. Subsequently, evaluate the effectiveness of the optimized tf-idf vectorizer in the movie recommendation process. Following the preprocessing steps, construct the recommendation system using the tf-idf vectors and compare its performance with pre-trained models from the Gensim library featuring diverse word embeddings.
